## What to expect
[TODO]

## Agenda
Each Call will be structured like this:

- Warm introduction from the host/s (@first 3 minutes)
  - Code Of Conduct
- (this needs to be defined and indefinite)
- Fairwell (@last 2 minutes)

## Code Of Conduct
All participants are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct).

But at the heart of everything, please respect the following:

Be sensitive to all participants and foster an open and safe environment in any way you can, and
most especially with your use of language. Allow participants to have their chance to speak and
don't infringe on them speaking. If you're giving feedback to a participant please deliver it
respectfully, and to those who are responding to do so with grace.  And lastly come prepared
to do a lot of listening and to share yourself freely.

## Volunteering
Organizing tasks are a lot of work but the outcome and
and the time we get share together makes it all worth it. <br>
If you'd like to help out please contact @grahamc or @worldofpeace in
the appropriate channels.
